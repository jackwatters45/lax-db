# Lax DB

## Features

- historical db
   - just well done basic analysis on games players, etc. basically what i would want to do with gb if I had all the time in the world. Start with just ncaa stats and then try to move to some more personal data. eventually add pll, wll as well
- film
   - literally just compile some good film resources
- something with computer vision
- blog
   - opinions, technical breakdowns, history (expand on this probably)
- cameo like player analysis
   - pro / college players can break down user submitted game film for a fee.
   - similar thing with stringers
- Stringing DB
